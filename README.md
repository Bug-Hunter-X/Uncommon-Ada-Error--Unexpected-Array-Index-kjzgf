This example demonstrates a potential runtime error in Ada related to array indexing. The code iterates through an array and doubles each element's value. However, it lacks robust error handling for scenarios where the array might contain unexpected values or if there's a possibility of accessing indices outside the array's defined bounds.  The solution provides a more robust version with explicit error checks and better exception handling.
